        <h2>1997 Nike Foamposite</h2>

            This shoes was crazy at the time because of the new Foamposite technology
            they claimed the shoe had.
        </p>
        <p>Foamposite technology was debuted with this shoe and one other model</p>

        <h2>1997 Air Jordan 13</h2>
        <p>
            This shoe was inspired by the panther, featuring a hologram by the ankle
            to represent a panther's eye when light reflects off it.
        </p>
        <p>Designed by Tinker Hatfield ,The sole resembles a panther's paw.</p>

        <h2>1999 Atmos x Air Force 1</h2>
        <p>
            The air force has been released in so many different colorways over the
            years.
        </p>
        <p>One of the first collabs that involved Air Forces.</p>
        <h2>2000 Air Jordan 5 Black Metallic</h2>
        <p>Was retro many times since it was such a popular shoe.</p>
        <p>
            Newer year Jordans quality is lacking sometimes but back in 2000 the
            quality of shoes was greater.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a White Metallic that released along with these I like the black
            version better because they are easier to keep clean.
        </p>
        <h2>2001 Nike Dunk Low CO.jp Veneer</h2>
        <p>Was released last year because of how popular dunks became.</p>

            it.

            the shoe.

        <p>Such a rare shoe it goes for $5753 in a size 10.</p>
        <h2>2004 Nike x Huf Air Max 90</h2>
        <p>
            The owner of HUF recently passed away so these shoes increased in price.
        </p>
        <p>

            Shoe is extremely hard to come by in any condition but in the box brand
            new is basically unheard of.
